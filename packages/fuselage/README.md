### Building

As this package dependends on others in this monorepo, before anything run the following at the root directory:

<!--yarn(build)-->

```sh
yarn build
```

<!--/yarn(build)-->

### Linting

To ensure the source is matching our coding style, we perform [linting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>).
Before commiting, check if your code fits our style by running:

<!--yarn(lint)-->

```sh
yarn lint
```

<!--/yarn(lint)-->

Some linter warnings and errors can be automatically fixed:

<!--yarn(lint-and-fix)-->

```sh
yarn lint-and-fix
```

<!--/yarn(lint-and-fix)-->

### Running tests

Whenever possible, add tests to describe exactly what your code do. You can run them by yourself:

<!--yarn(test)-->

```sh
yarn test
```

<!--/yarn(test)-->

### Component stories

We develop and describe our visual components in the form of stories, manage by a tool called [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
To start developing with Storybook, run:

<!--yarn(storybook)-->

```sh
yarn storybook
```

<!--/yarn(storybook)-->
